What I need to do a better job of is not managing my time, but rather caring for myself and identifying my true interests. When I am well rested and working on something I am genuinely excited about, finding time is rarely a problem."

    "quote": "I think about decisions in three ways: hats, haircuts, and tattoos.\n\nMost decisions are like hats. Try one and if you don’t like it, put it back and try another. The cost of a mistake is low, so move quickly and try a bunch of hats.\n\nSome decisions are like haircuts. You can fix a bad one, but it won’t be quick and you might feel foolish for awhile. That said, don’t be scared of a bad haircut. Trying something new is usually a risk worth taking. If it doesn’t work out, by this time next year you will have moved on and so will everyone else.\n\nA few decisions are like tattoos. Once you make them, you have to live with them. Some mistakes are irreversible. Maybe you’ll move on for a moment, but then you’ll glance in the mirror and be reminded of that choice all over again. Even years later, the decision leaves a mark. When you’re dealing with an irreversible choice, move slowly and think carefully."

In a surprising number of cases, something remarkable is possible if you have the courage to ask.\n\nNever expect people to say yes. Everyone is busy and balancing multiple priorities. Your request is not their responsibility. When you’re told no, move on lightly and freely. The world is full of opportunity."

How much time is spent reading other people’s posts on social media, watching other people’s exploits in the news, listening to other people’s ideas on podcasts? Go have coffee with a friend. Go make something. Go outside. All those hours spent looking at someone else’s life on a screen could be used to take action in your own life."

    "quote": "Some people get addicted to chain-smoking their problems. They spend all day going from sorrow to sorrow. It doesn’t have to be that way. You can live each day going from joy to joy—like a sunflower that turns to face the sun as it moves across the sky. It’s not about having a problem-free life, but about focusing on the light. Sunflowers still have shadows, but they are always behind them."

    "quote": "Holding onto anger and resentment is like scuba diving with an anchor. As long as you’re clinging to it, you’re bound to the seabed, limited in movement, unable to appreciate the coral reefs and the colorful fish that dart in and out of view.\n\nForgiveness is letting go of the anchor. It isn’t about declaring what was done to you is okay, but about unburdening yourself so you can swim freely. Forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. It’s the gift of letting go of the anchors you’ve been carrying."

  {
    "quote": "I split problems into two groups: muddy puddles and leaky ceilings.\n\nSome problems are like muddy puddles. The way to clear a muddy puddle is to leave it alone. The more you mess with it, the muddier it becomes. Many of the problems I dream up when I’m overthinking or worrying or ruminating fall into this category. Is life really falling apart or am I just in a sour mood? Is this as hard as I’m making it or do I just need to go workout? Drink some water. Go for a walk. Get some sleep. Go do something else and give the puddle time to turn clear.\n\nOther problems are like a leaky ceiling. Ignore a small leak and it will always widen. Relationship tension that goes unaddressed. Overspending that becomes a habit. One missed workout drifting into months of inactivity. Some problems multiply when left unattended. You need to intervene now.\n\nAre you dealing with a leak or a puddle?"

  {
    "quote": "Anytime in my life when I have managed to go from a vision to a reality, the vision has not been a plan but a practice.\n\nIn other words, what matters is not having a vision, but rather making a habit of returning to and revising the vision. For the big things in my life, I’m always coming back to them week after week—sometimes day after day. As new information arrives, the vision gets updated. The dream becomes more crystallized over time. It’s a habit of thinking about where you want to go with an ever-increasing degree of clarity.\n\nYou do not need a vision, you need the practice of envisioning."

  {
    "quote": "If you already live a comfortable life, then choosing to make more money but live a worse daily life is a bad trade.\n\nAnd yet, we talk ourselves into it all the time. We take promotions that pay more, but swallow our free time. We already have a successful business, but we break ourselves trying to make it even more successful.\n\nToo much focus on wealth, not enough focus on lifestyle."

  {
    "quote": "Mastery is not only about getting better at your craft, but also about finding ways to eliminate the obstacles, distractions, and other annoyances that prevent you from working on your craft.\n\nTop performers find ways to spend as much time as possible on what matters and as little time as possible on what doesn’t. It is not someone else’s responsibility to create the conditions for success.\n\nYou have to actively work to eliminate the things that don’t matter from your workload. If you haven’t figured out how to do that, you haven’t mastered your craft."

    "quote": "People can help you in many ways throughout life, but there are two things nobody can give you: curiosity and drive. They must be self-supplied.\n\nIf you are not interested and curious, all the information in the world can be at your fingertips, but it will be relatively useless. If you are not motivated and driven, whatever connections or opportunities are available to you will be rendered inert.\n\nNow, you won’t feel curious and driven about every area of life, and that’s fine. But it really pays to find something that lights you up. This is one of the primary quests of life: to find the thing that ignites your curiosity and drive.\n\nThere are many recipes for success. There is no single way to win. But nearly all recipes include two ingredients: curiosity and drive."

  {
    "quote": "You will never find one answer to what makes you happy. There are many answers, and they change based on your current state.\n\nPeople need to relax, but if all you do is sit on the beach, it gets old. People find meaning in work, but if all you do is work, it gets exhausting. People benefit from exercise, but if all you do is exercise, it gets unhealthy.\n\nHappiness will always be fleeting because your needs change over time. The question is: what do you need right now?"

  {
    "quote": "My personal rule is that it’s a good idea to be patient as long as I’m in the mix.\n\nIf I’m taking action, putting in my reps, and trying things out, then I should remain patient and see what opportunities arise. But if I’m not taking action consistently, then I’m not practicing patience. I’m just waiting."

  {
    "quote": "Whether you are an adult or child, your first attempts will often seem unimportant or foolish.\n\nThe open mic night at a nearly empty bar.\nThe early blog posts that get ignored.\nThe dance recital on a little stage.\n\nEarly attempts are easy to dismiss because they don’t seem to amount to much. But you have to do the low stakes stuff to prepare for the high stakes stuff. They are the building blocks of confidence, and that’s an enormous thing."
