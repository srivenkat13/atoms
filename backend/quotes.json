If it doesn’t work out, by this time next year you will have moved on and so will everyone else.\n\nA few decisions are like tattoos. Once you make them, you have to live with them. Some mistakes are irreversible. Maybe you’ll move on for a moment, but then you’ll glance in the mirror and be reminded of that choice all over again. Even years later, the decision leaves a mark.

No, I don’t think that’s necessary. But a good day — a meaningful and fulfilling day — requires small moments of discomfort. Growth demands discomfort. We need something to push against to learn how strong we can become."

It’s easy to talk yourself out of the early attempts because they feel kind of meaningless.\n\nBut every race starts with one step. Every fortune starts with a small deposit. Every book begins as one sentence.\n\nThe real question is not “What is my current position?"
